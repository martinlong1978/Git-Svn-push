This is a simple one-way GIT to SVN sync. It will push up your GIT branches to a central SVN server. You should lock down the SVN server so that only a single user can commit - the one which is running GitSvnPush, otherwise any commits made by other people will be reverted (effectively overwritten) by the script.

It will push up all of your branches, finding, where possible, the correct branch point. It does not write any mergeinfo - that should never be needed if the SVN repo remains read-only. 

Still needs tidying up. I'd like to try and figure out someday how to make this work without SVN working copies, and maybe ever with a bare GIT repo.
